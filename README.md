## Dataset: [CDC Nutrition Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spittman1248/cdc-data-nutrition-physical-activity-obesity)

Data Cleaning:
1. Addressing missing values by either imputation using appropriate statistical measures or just removing incomplete records.
2. Identifying and managing outliers to prevent them from skewing the analysis and statistics.
3. Checking and standardizing data types across variables to maintain uniformity.
4. Remove any duplicate records to maintain data integrity.

Stratification (organise data into meaningful subgroups):
1. Stratified Sampling: Divided the dataset into homogeneous strata to ensure representation from various groups.
2. Stratum-wise Analysis: Performed analysis within each stratum to derive insights specific to different segments.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Computed descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to summarize the central tendencies and spread of numerical variables.
2. Utilized various visualization techniques (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to depict distributions, trends and relationships among variables.
3. Examined the distribution of variables to assess their skewness and kurtosis (tailedness).
4. Derived insights and made initial observations to guide further analysis and modeling.
